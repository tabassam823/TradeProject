Abstract
In this article we introduce a portfolio optimisation framework, in which the use of rough
path signatures [Lyo98] provides a novel method of incorporating path-dependencies in the
joint signal-asset dynamics, naturally extending traditional factor models, while keeping the
resulting formulas lightweight, tractable and easily interpretable. Specifically, we achieve this by
representing a trading strategy as a linear functional applied to the signature of a path (which we
refer to as “Signature Trading” or “Sig-Trading”). This allows the modeller to efficiently encode
the evolution of past time-series observations into the optimisation problem. In particular,
we derive a concise formulation of the dynamic mean-variance criterion alongside an explicit
solution in our setting, which naturally incorporates a drawdown control in the optimal strategy
over a finite time horizon. Secondly, we draw parallels between classical portfolio stategies and
Sig-Trading strategies and explain how the latter leads to a pathwise extension of the classical
setting via the “Signature Efficient Frontier”. Finally, we give explicit examples when trading
under an exogenous signal as well as examples for momentum and pair-trading strategies,
demonstrated both on synthetic and market data. Our framework combines the best of both
worlds between classical theory (whose appeal lies in clear and concise formulae) and between
modern, flexible data-driven methods (usually represented by ML approaches) that can handle
more realistic datasets. The advantage of the added flexibility of the latter is that one can
bypass common issues such as the accumulation of heteroskedastic and asymmetric residuals
during the optimisation phase. Overall, Sig-Trading combines the flexibility of data-driven
methods without compromising on the clarity of the classical theory and our presented results
provide a compelling toolbox that yields superior results for a large class of trading strategies.

Introduction

The design and construction of trading strategies is a fundamental aspect of finance and subsequently, has been extensively researched in the past decades. Creating a trading strategy can
mainly be divided into two areas: extracting alpha and allocating the associated risk. Methods of
extracting alpha depend on the trade horizon or trade frequency and are often achieved through statistical techniques, which can then be incorporated into a parametric model. Meanwhile, allocating
the associated risk generally depends on your choice of model and objective criterion; conventionally, optimisation methods are deployed to find a transformation of the signal-asset dynamics
that maximises the chosen utility function of the strategy PnL, with respect to the underlying
model. The work ([Mar52]) of Markowitz introduced modern portfolio theory based on portfolio
allocation determined by investors’ preferences to risk and returns, resulting in a well-diversified
portfolio. Classical methods consist of fixing a class of probabilistic parametric models and calibrating the model’s parameters with respect to the empirical price process. Depending on the choice
of parametric model and its corresponding parameters, the optimal portfolio will be different. In
well-studied families of models it is possible to find closed-form expressions of the optimal portfolio
given certain risk and return preferences, however in more complex parametric models or with more
general utility functions, explicit solutions may not be attainable and so numerical techniques are
used.

We can observe from the above blueprint, that the possible choices of model are vast - for
example all possible ways of feature engineering, return prediction, or the choice of probabilistic
model. The choice of optimisation technique will then be tailored to the choice of utility function
and the model. While well-studied models provide a useful benchmark for practitioners, many of

2

the assumptions made are restrictive. Several modelling assumptions do not reflect stylised facts in
practice such as non-stationarity, heavy tails and path-dependent volatility ([Fuk21; Das22; GL22;
MMB23]) - all of which are exhibited by financial time-series data ([Con01]). The latter considerations are even more relevant when working with multiple assets since dependence structures are
highly non-linear, often with cross-sectional trend- and mean-reversion patterns occurring in practice. Recent research activity has brought modelling approaches to the forefront that are inherently
data-driven and provide a highly flexible framework that is able to capture a broader set of asset
dynamics than currently used classical stochastic models did. Data-driven techniques for trading
have increased in recent years due to the rise of machine learning applications in finance, such as
in [ZZR20b; Wan19; ZZR20a; Jai+21; Van+21; PZ22; GPZ21; CJC22], as well as in hedging applications in [Büh+18; HTZ21; LH23]. The requirement for complex and accurate synthetic data to
train and test trading frameworks has also led to extensive research in developing market generators
([Bue+21; Wie+19; Ni+20; Ni+21; Iss+23]). In this work, we go a step further than just modelling
asset dynamics in a model-free way and take the approach of utilising rough path theory ([Lyo14;
FV10]) also to develop a trading strategy that is determined by the expected signature of the joint
signal-asset process. Since the aforementioned expected signature uniquely determines the law of
the stochastic process ([CL13]), it is immediate to see how the techniques simplify to the classical
case when applied to traditional stochastic models. By taking a pathwise approach to trading,
this naturally alleviates probabilistic restrictions, resulting in a model-free or model-agnostic setup
([CC23]). A pathwise setting has been used in [PP16; Rig16a; Rig16b; ACX23], and has more
recently been utilised to handle more general portfolios in [All+21], as well as in applications to
derivative pricing and calibration in [CGS22] and optimal stopping problems in [Bay+21].
Inspired by the work of Perez et al. in [Arr18; KLA20; LNA19b], we adopt the idea of representing a trading strategy as a linear functional applied to the signature of a path and extend this
to to incorporate exogenous market signals and multiple assets. We can think of a trading strategy
as a decision made using the knowledge of the current state (e.g. the previous price path, plus some
exogenous trading signal); in other words as a function from path space to some decision process.
In practice, the true driving processes are most likely not (directly) observable and hidden by layers
of noise. Hence the mapping from the previous price process to a trading strategy is often done first
by removing noise in the system through stochastic filtering [BC09; CLO21] (i.e. an exponentially
weighted moving average or Kalman filter) and then optimised based on the resulting prediction.
Recently, the authors in [Coh+23] prove how the Kalman filter can in fact be equivalently written
as a linear regression on the signature. Work has also been conducted in [DCS21; Dye+22] with
relation to approximate Bayesian computation using signatures. This naturally prompts the question - can the class of linear functionals on the signature be seen as a rich enough class of maps that
represent such trading strategies? We will show that this is possible to due to signatures’ capability
to approximate continuous functions on paths. Also perhaps crucially, the Sig-Trading framework
does not impose the restriction that the underlying asset or signal be Markovian, allowing the SigTrader to capture auto-correlation and mean-reverting behaviours within the process that perhaps
some more classical methods are not able to exploit. This enables us to incorporate path-dependent
considerations into our trading decisions, while still obtaining a closed-form solution, that is easy
to compute and simple to analyse.
The paper is organised as follows: In Section 2 we introduce key foundations of Sig-Trading and
the concept of the extension to classical factor models. In Section 3 we present our main result,
an analytic solution to the dynamic mean-variance criterion for Sig-Trading and compare this to
original factor models, whilst introducing a Sig-Trading version of the efficient frontier. Finally, in
Section 4 we discuss its implementation and in Section 5 we highlight the advantages of Sig-Trading,
provide intuitive examples and demonstrate its possible use cases in practice, such as pairs trading,
momentum, and trading under an exogenous signal.

Background and Motivation

The Objective
In this article, we are concerned with finding an optimal systematic and dynamic trading strategy
such that the trader continuously updates their position as new information filters in. This is done
with no discretion and is defined as a function of the market state, which continuously updates
through time, leading to a new position for each time t.
We denote T ∈ R the terminal time. Let (Ω, F, (Ft )t∈[0,T ] , P) be a filtered probability space.
Furthermore, denote by X = (Xt )t∈[0,T ] a non-negative Rd -valued stochastic process satisfying
X0m = 1 for m ∈ {1, . . . , d}. We are interested in finding an optimal, predictable dynamic trading
strategy (ξ)t∈[0,T ] that maximises the expected utility of the PnL

where VT is the terminal value of the trading strategy (i.e the PnL)
VT =

(1.2)

m=1 0

Here, the optimal strategy ξ is a function of the market state (i.e filtration F at time t) and
its optimality is with respect to the constraints and utility function that the trader chooses. In
order to solve such an optimisation problem, commonly methods are constructed from the following
structure:
1. Fix a framework to model the underlying dynamics of X,
2. Choose an objective criterion (utility and constraints),
3. Optimisation with respect to (1) and (2).
Most likely, a trader may be trading under the presence of exogenous information f to enrich
the filtration F (and hence the model of the dynamics of X). Recently, extensive research in
this direction has been conducted in optimal execution literature, e.g. in a more classical setting
in [LN19; For+22; SC22; CDM22; BCK23; CMN23] and with machine learning applications in
[BDG21; CDO23]. In this work, we do not consider market impact, but refer the reader to [KLA20;
CAS22] to work in this area involving signatures.
Modelling Dynamics
The choice of model in (1) often requires explicitly predicting asset returns through supervised
learning techniques. Therefore, a large number of models tend to fall into the predict-then-optimise
framework, where heavy assumptions are made on the asset returns/market factors that are input
into any prediction, leaving the final solution exposed to asymmetric and compounded errors.
Solutions to these problems are very well studied with specific assumptions and restrictions on
the underlying asset process, however without these assumptions this can be much more difficult.
In such stochastic control problems, the asset dynamics are explained by a diffusion process and
dynamic programming can then be used to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation.
In practice, the future expected returns (the drift of the process X), µt+1 , are often predicted
via supervised learning methods, using trading signals or factors as statistical predictors which
are embedded into the framework itself ([CR83; NER92; FF93; FF15; SW10; GP13]). A generic
(linear) factor model models the asset returns at time t, as
µt+1 = E[rt+1 |Ft ] = Bft + εt+1
4

(1.3)

where r is the d-dimensional asset returns, B is a d × N matrix of factor coefficients, ft is a vector
of N factor returns and ε is a vector of the d assets’ (unexplained) residuals returns. This is set up
as a supervised linear regression on future returns, as a function of the trading signals/factors.
However, when working with financial data, there is generally a very low signal to noise ratio
and the residual terms ϵt are badly behaved, violating many statistical assumptions. Due to autocorrelation, non-stationarity and path-dependent volatility in the underlying asset X (and also
the signal f ), this framework can very quickly become problematic, and these asymmetric errors
are then compounded in the optimisation phase. In order to capture some of the autocorrelation in the residuals, a trader could incorporate the path into the signal f via stochastic filtering
([BC09; CLO21]). Traders may also scale returns for volatility in order to remove heteroskedasticity
([Eng01]), log transform to remove asymmetricity or winsorise to remove fat tails; in [Das22], the
roughness of signals is also discussed. However, there still remains a large amount of discretion in
such feature engineering and we will show that the signature can be used efficiently and robustly
to tackle these issues in a data-driven manner. To avoid the accumulation of mis-specified error
terms from the prediction phase, end-to-end (E2E) approaches using machine learning frameworks
have been used in [CI22] and [Zha+21] to ensure robustness by bypassing the prediction stage.

Choice of Utility
Once we have a model that characterises the dynamics of the driving signal and the underlying
asset, we can proceed to transforming this into a trading strategy position. How one does this
depends on a variety of conditions such as the type of strategy, if we are trading multiple assets, risk
preferences, trade frequency and investment horizon. Common objective criteria focus on a single
trade-by-trade optimisation basis, overlooking the potential path that the trading strategy will
take. However as alluded to previously, in practice signals and underlying assets can have strong
temporal dependencies and so subsequent trading strategy positions will inherit autocorrelation
structure.
As a motivating example in Figure 2, we consider the comparison between a strategy that is
mean-reverting (has autocorrelation) vs one that doesn’t. Both strategies yield identical daily PnL
distributions (and hence Sharpe ratio), but have different distributions at a future time due to
the temporal structure within the strategy over time. By optimising with respect to a future time
horizon, we are inherently optimising for a dynamic criterion that is dependent on the path. This
approach naturally integrates a drawdown control in the optimisation, since drawdowns are a pathdependent characteristic. Achieving a strategy with a small maximum drawdown either requires a
strong trend-to-noise ratio (high Sharpe ratio) or relies on the strategy being mean-reverting during
volatile periods ([RSB17] provides a neat analysis).
Mean-variance optimisation, perhaps the most widely known choice of utility function, was
first introduced in Markowitz’s thesis ([Mar52]). He demonstrated that it was natural to construct

an objective function that rewarded positive returns while penalizing associated risk (via variance). Subsequently, this framework has been researched extensively in the literature, including
the CAPM asset pricing framework ([Sha64]). In this work, we extend this approach to integrate
path-dependencies and optimise under a dynamic mean-variance criterion. We do so by simultaneously capturing path-dependent structure in the dynamics, while managing path-dependent
variance through the lifetime of the trade. The general dynamic mean-variance optimisation can
be framed as

Optimisation
Depending on the choice of underlying model, the optimisation method can be different - for
example, reinforcement learning can in fact be used to simulataneously learn the model and the
optimal strategy ([WZ19; BT23; Soo+23]). The authors in [KEA19] provide an extensive overview
of alternate formulations and methods for mean-variance optimisation. In the case of the predictthen-optimise framework, such as (1.3), the mean-variance solution is given by
ξt∗ =

1 −1
Σ µt
λ t

(1.5)

where Σt is the d × d covariance matrix of asset returns at time t and µt is the d × 1 vector of
expected returns over the next time period t ∈ [0, 1]. This solution is highly intuitive and tractable.
The performance of such a trading strategy is then mostly reliant on the predictive power of the
signal that goes into the model, as well as the well-posedness of the covariance structure, leaving
flexibility and responsibility in the hands of the trader. However, as has been highlighted in decades
of literature, this framework is highly restrictive, such as the assumption of normally distributed
returns and stationarity in the factor signal.

Summary of Contributions

Several stylised facts exhibited in asset prices are not represented in most classical dynamic optimisation frameworks. Many of these stylised facts, such as slow decaying autocorrelation and
volatility clustering, are path-dependent properties and so it advantageous to incorporate pathdependence into any factor model. Due to such characteristics in financial time series data, the
predict-then-optimise composition in classical factor models can be prone to asymmetric errors that
are compounded through the optimisation process. Work from [CI22] and [Zha+21] have provided
robust machine learning approaches to help account for this issue by bypassing the direct prediction
phase. Alternatively, we are able to exploit such dynamics in the signal and asset and incorporate
these not only to increase expected return, but to dynamically reduce variance of PnL. Due to
the powerful properties arising in rough path theory we are able to simultaneously incorporate
such dynamics into both the modelling framework and the optimisation phase at the same time,
bypassing any explicit prediction.
In summary, our contribution is to extend the existing signature trading strategy framework
first presented in the thesis of Perez ([Per20]), by deriving a closed form mean-variance optimal
trading strategy for multiple assets that accounts for path-dependent dynamics between exogenous
trading signals and the underlying assets, thereby providing a pathwise extension to classical factor
models. Our framework is simple to implement and does not require heavy machinery while comparative machine learning methods may require extensive network building and hyperparameter
tuning every time the trader wants to perform a new optimisation. This is possible due to the
mathematical properties of the signature allowing us to linearise the objective function, meaning
it is relatively straightforward to solve for an explicit closed-form solution. Sig-Trading is a onemodel-fits-all type framework that is flexible enough to adapt to any type of underlying asset and
market factor process. Once a linear functional ℓ is obtained from past data samples it is straightforward to unravel this into an implementable trading strategy characterised by the number of units
to buy/sell at each time point t ∈ [0, T ]. Since the strategy is dynamic, as new data arrives the
Sig-Trader will continuously compute the signature and update their position accordingly.

The Modelling Setup of the Sig-Factor Model

Rough path theory has provided many valuable tools, such as the Signature of a path, to help shift
the focus from probabilistic to pathwise approaches when working with streams of data. The concept of the signature was first introduced in [Che57; Che77] and has played a crucial role in rough
path theory in [Lyo98; LCL07; FV10; FH20]. Recent mathematical finance literature has benefited
immensely from its universality property, which states that linear functionals on the signature are
dense in the space of continuous functions on compact sets of paths (Theorem A.13). This result
allows to approximate a trading strategy as a linear functional on the terms of the signature. Incorporating higher order path-dependent characteristics via the signature allows us to capture stylised
facts of financial time series data, without requiring or imposing an explicit probability distribution
on the future returns. In this section, we discuss the notion of a Signature Trading Strategy, first
introduced in [LNA19b], and how this is incorporated into a model-free setting, as well as under
the presence of exogenous market signals.

2.1

The Signature

In this section, we first recall definitons of path augmentations and how these are used in preceding
results such as Theorem 2.10, which is crucial for our main result Theorem 3.1. Whilst we introduce
fundamental definitions in Section 2.1, we have collected some basic concepts and definitions from
rough path theory for convenience in Appendix A as they may aide in understanding of notations
and technicalities throughout the paper. For a more thorough introduction to signatures, see for
example [Gyu+13; CK16; LLN13; Fer21; LM22] for excellent articles focusing on intuition and
7

understanding in a practical setting. For specific applications of signatures in finance we refer the
reader to [Bon+19; KLA20; ASS20; Bay+21; CGS22; Ald+22; DT23; IH23; WKM23].
Unless stated otherwise, the process (Xt )t∈[0,T ] is a continuous, stochastic process defined on
a filtered probability space (Ω, F, (Ft )t∈[0,T ] , P). We often refer to the path trajectories of the
process (Xt )t∈[0,T ] as X : [0, T ] → Rd , which we assume can be lifted to geometric rough paths
(Definition A.6).
Definition 2.1. (Time reparameterisation). Let X : [0, T ] → Rd , φ : [0, T ] → [T1 , T2 ] a nondecreasing surjection, then the re-parameterised path is denoted as X ◦ φ =: X φ : [T1 , T2 ] → Rd .
Definition 2.2. (Add-time process). Often, we may wish to preserve the temporal structure of a
path and so we keep the time parameterisation of the path X by defining a new process, X̂. We
denote the time-augmented process by X̂t = (t, Xt ), t ∈ [0, T ] such that (t, Xt ) =: X̂ : [0, T ] →
Rd+1 .
Definition 2.3. (Hoff Lead-Lag Process, [Hof06], [FHL16]). Let X̂ : [0, T ] → Rd+1 be the continuous time-augmented process of X, discretely sampled at t = t0 , . . . , t2N . The Hoff lead-lag
transformed path is defined as the piecewise linear interpolation X̂ LL : [0, T ] → R2(d+1) such that

if t ∈ [2k + 23 , 2k + 2].

Remark 2.1. There also exists a more intuitive and straightforward definition of a lead-lag process, however we decide not to opt for this version and instead consider the so-called Hoff process
([Hof06]), due to its fundamental properties in the case when we want to calculate the PnL of our
trading strategy (Theorem 2.10). This is due to the powerful, non-trivial result proven in [FHL16]
that states that the Itô integral of a function of a process X against itself, can be recovered via the
components of the Hoff lead-lag transformation. This will be made more precise in Section 2.2.

Sig-Factor Model

In this section, we develop and collect the tools required in order to find optimal trading strategies
with respect to a given objective criterion. The key ingredient is that we can approximate a trading
strategy as a linear functional on the signature of the path, which is formulated in Theorem 2.8.
Then, by embedding the market factor process (Definition 2.6) as a geometric rough path via
9

the signature and using Theorem 2.10, we alleviate most probabilistic restrictions that classical
methods may have. Theorem 2.11 subsequently allows us to in fact bypass the Itô integral entirely
and express the expected PnL as a linear functional on the expected Hoff lead-lag signature. Hence,
all that remains to be done in order to optimise under a given criterion (i.e mean-variance), is to
solve an optimisation problem - equating to solving a system of linear equations.
We consider the scenario, as is often the case in practice, that we observe a much larger
market state than just the asset trajectories themselves, i.e we observe the natural filtration of a
new process that consists of the original price trajectories, enriched with some new market factors
ft = (ft1 , . . . , ftN ). A market factor can be any un-tradable characteristic, classified as a stochastic
process (ft )t∈[0,T ] that may be used in tandem with our framework, in order to enrich the market
state and provide predictability. In practice, factors are chosen and understood as a driving signal
of the the underlying process. Unless stated otherwise, we assume the underlying asset process
(Xt )t∈[0,T ] is a continuous, stochastic process whose path trajectories can be lifted to geometric
rough paths (Definition A.6). We note that, while our price process may be a semi-martingale, we
do not require any restriction on the nature of the exogenous market signals, where as traditional
factor models may require stationarity.
Definition 2.6. (Market factor process). Let X = (Xt )t∈[0,T ] be a d-dimensional tradable underlying asset process and {f i }N
i=1 are N un-tradable exogenous trading signals. Then we define the
(time-augmented) market factor process as the (1 + d + N )-dimensional process
Ẑt := (t, Xt , ft )
that induces the natural filtered probability sapce (Ω, F Z , (FtZ )t∈[0,T ] , P), where the filtration of X
satisfies F X ⊆ F Z such that X is driven by {f i }N
i=1 . Throughout the remainder of this paper, we
maintain such assumptions on Ẑ. We define as the space of all market factor trajectories for given
assets X and factors f .
f
:= { Ẑt = (t, Xt , ft ) | X : [0, T ] → Rd , and f : [0, T ] → RN and Z0 = (0, 1, 1) }

Definition 2.7. (Exogenous Signature Trading Strategy). Let Ẑ be a market factor process as
defined in Definition 2.6. Let ξ = (ξ)t∈[0,T ] be an adapted, FtZ -predictable and integrable strategy
RT
such that 0 ξs2 ds < ∞. If the strategy ξ is then a function of the market state, that is ξt = ϕ(Ẑ0,t ),
a continuous function of the previous market factor trajectory up to time t. We can extend ξ to be
a signature trading strategy, such that
ξtm = ⟨ℓm , Ẑ0,t ⟩ ≈ ϕ(t, Z0,t ),

∀m = 1, . . . , d.

We define the space of all exogenous signature trading strategies with respect to market factors f
as

) ) .

Remark 2.2. If instead we wanted to trade endogenously without any trading signals, we would
simply take the market factors to be the null-process ∅, such that X̂ = Ẑ, the results would still
hold.
Now that we have defined the framework required in order to trade a signature trading strategy
embedded with market factors, we can state a key result in order to combine the importance of the
Hoff process in Theorem 2.10, that allows us to explicitly state the PnL of the exogenous sig-trader
without the need for an integral at all.
10

f
Lemma 2.8. Let Z0,T
⊂ K ⊂ C 1−var ([0, T ], Rd ) be a compact set of market factor trajectories.
Then for any exogenous signature trading strategy ξ = ϕ(Ẑ0,T ) that acts on paths in K and for
every ϵ > 0, there exists a linear functional ℓ ∈ T ((RN +d+1 )∗ ), such that

sup ∥ϕ(Ẑ0,T ) − ⟨ℓ, Ẑ0,T ⟩∥ < ϵ.

Z∈K

Proof. We can see that this result follows from the universal approximation of continuous functions
on paths by linear functionals acting on the signature (Theorem A.13).
Definition 2.9. (Trading Strategy PnL). Let Ẑ = (t, Xt , ft ) be a market factor process with X a
tradable underlying process and f an untradable signal process. If ξ ∈ Af,sig is a linear signature
trading strategy such that ξtm = ⟨ℓm , Ẑ0,t ⟩, for each asset m = 1, . . . , d, then we define the PnL of
the signature trading strategy between time 0 and time T as
VT =

d Z T
X
m=1 0

⟨ℓm , Ẑ0,t ⟩dXtm

(2.1)

where the integral is understood in the Itô sense.
It is crucial to distinguish the difference between the Itô integral used in this definition versus the
Stratonovich integral in (2) of Example A.3. If that integral was in fact an Itô integral then we
could describe the above definition of PnL directly in terms of the add-time signature Ẑ0,t , however
this is unfortunately not the case! So in order to develop a more friendly version of VT , we require
the following theorem involving the Hoff lead-lag process as seen in Definition 2.3.
Theorem 2.10. (Recovery of Itô Integral using the Hoff process, (Theorem 5.1, [FHL16])). Let
X = (Xt )t∈[0,T ] be a stochastic process on the filtered probability space (Ω, F, (Ft )t∈[0,T ] , P). Suppose
we observe piecewise smooth streams of X that are discretely sampled over a sequence of times
LL = (X̂ lead , X̂ lag )2N be the associated observed Hoff lead-lag transform of X̂ as
{ti }N
ti
ti i=1
i=0 . Let X̂
defined in Definition 2.3. Let ϕ = (ϕ1 , . . . , ϕd ) be continuous functions acting on paths of X, then
we have that

in either probability or Lp -norm.
Proof. The basic idea of the proof is that the areas between the lead and lag components of the
Hoff lead-lag process, (captured by X̂ LL ), introduce a correction factor in the stochastic integral
limit, consequently allowing us to recover the Itô, not Stratonovich, integral.
This result allows us to show that applying a function to the observed lagged path, against
the observed leading path, we recover the true Itô integral against the stochastic process X as the
mesh size goes to zero. In this sense, we see that we are able to approximate asymptotically the
true Itô integral as instead an integral of the observed, Hoff lead-lag stream.
Remark 2.3. We can clearly see the analogy with Theorem 2.10 and our definition of PnL in
Definition 2.9. By transforming our asset price data via the Hoff lead-lag process, now regarded
as a geometric rough path, the quadratic variation of the underlying process X naturally arises.
The path-dependent concept of volatility has been researched extensively ([BCD98; GJR14; JL20;
GL22]) and this is explicitly embedded in the second order of the signature of the Hoff process.
11

So not only does this result allow us to capture the path-dependency of volatility, which is mostly
endogenous, we can enrich this with other path-dependent market factors.

Figure 4: Distinguishing between the true stochastic process X and the discretely sampled
observed process for which we define the Hoff lead-lag process.
We can see from Figure 4 that in order for Theorem 2.10 to hold, we require frequent sampling
such that the distance between observations is small. A natural next step is to consider the case
where our strategy ξ is in fact a signature trading strategy, i.e ξtm = ⟨ℓm , Ẑ0,t ⟩ for each asset
m = 1, . . . , d. Moreover, how can we find an expression for the PnL VT in (2.1), in the Itô integral
sense, using Theorem 2.10? We will in fact extend this idea to a much more powerful result, under
the presence of exogenous market signals.
Theorem 2.11. (PnL of a d-asset signature trading strategy under exogenous signal). Let Ẑ :=
(t, Xt , ft )t∈[0,T ] be the market factor process, where X is a d-dimensional tradable stochastic process
and f is a N -dimensional un-tradable factor process. Let ℓ1 , . . . , ℓd ∈ T ((RN +d+1 )∗ ) and define our
trading strategy as ξtm = ⟨ℓm , Ẑ<∞
0,t ⟩ for m = 1, . . . , d. Then, we have that the PnL of the strategy
between time 0 and time T can be represented as
VT =

where π : T ((R2(N +d+1) )∗ ) → W(A2(N +d+1) ) the canonical isomorphism between the dual space
T ((R2(N +d+1) )∗ ) and the space of all words W(A2(N +d+1) ).
Now, due to the linearity of expectation, we are able to represent the expected PnL at time T as
the following:
E(VT ) =

Remark 2.4. This result allows us to express any integral of a linear functional on the signature of
a time-augmented market factor path as a newly defined linear functional on the time-augmented
lead-lag market factor path instead. We must note that the authors in ([LNA19a], Lemma 3.11),
construct a version in the specific case when d = 1, f = ∅ and so f (m) = 4. Here, we extend
this case to allow for any exogenous market information, as well as the multi dimensionsal case for
d > 1.

Remark 2.5. Note that f (m) : {1, . . . , d} → W(A2(N +d+1) ) is simply just the shift operator that
allows any multi-index (j1 , . . . , jn ) ∈ {1, . . . , d}n for the original signature terms to be transformed
into a multi-index for the signature terms of the 2(N + d + 1)-dimensional time-augmented lead-lag
process.
Example 2.1. Define the 4-dimensional market factor process Ẑ := (t, X 1 , X 2 , f 1 ) for two assets
and one corresponding factor. Consider the case where our signature trading strategy is truncated

terms. Notably, the 21 words associated with these signature terms W42 are defined as:

W42 = ∅, 0, 1, 2, 3, 00, 01, 02, 03, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33
and so any linear functional associated with the truncated expected signature, E(ẐLL,≤M
), will
0,T
have at most 21 non-zero terms. We can see that if we concatenate a linear functional ℓ with the
+1
letter f (m), then, it must be applied to the truncated signature ẐLL,≤M
and the words associated
0,T
with ℓf (m) will be wf (m) where w ∈ W42 . Throughout, we will refer to terms of the truncated
M
signature via words such as w, v ∈ Wd+N
+1 .
Lemma 2.12. (Variance of the PnL of a signature trading strategy under exogenous signal). Let
X be a d-dimensional tradable stochastic process and let f be a N -dimensional un-tradable factor
process. Define Ẑt := (t, Xt , ft ) as the market factor process and ℓ1 , . . . , ℓd ∈ T ((RN +d+1 )∗ ) and
define our trading strategy as ⟨ℓm , Ẑ<∞
0,s ⟩ for m = 1, . . . , d. Let the expected PnL of the strategy
between time 0 and time T be defined as in (2.3). Then the Variance of the PnL at time T is

Main Result

In this section we derive our main result, which is an explicit and concise expression for the optimal signature trading strategy in the presence of exogenous market signals considering a pathwise
version of the classical mean-variance criterion. Using the trading strategy expected PnL and variance of PnL as defined in Chapter 2, we show that the path-dependent mean-variance optimisation
problem is convex in the weights of the linear functionals ℓ1 , . . . , ℓd .
Theorem 3.1. (Optimal Signature Trading Strategy). Denote T ∈ N the terminal time. Let X be
a d-dimensional tradable stochastic process and let f be a N -dimensional un-tradable factor process.
Define Ẑt := (t, Xt , ft ) as the market factor process. Define a signature trading strategy ξtm through
a linear functional on the signature of the market factor process, i.e. ξtm = ⟨ℓm , Ẑ0,t ⟩. Then, for
a given truncation level M , the mean-variance optimal signature trading strategy ℓ∗ = (ℓ∗1 , . . . , ℓ∗d ),
ℓ∗m ∈ T (M ) ((RN +d+1 )∗ ), satisfies

Proof. In order to solve the constrained optimisation problem (3.1), we can introduce the Lagrangian
L(ℓ1 , . . . , ℓd , λ) = E(VT ) − λ(Var(VT ) − ∆)
and we are interested in finding saddle points ℓ∗1 , . . . , ℓ∗d ∈ T (M ) ((RN +d+1 )∗ ), λ0 ∈ R that satisfy
∇L(ℓ∗1 , . . . , ℓ∗d , λ) = 0. For this purpose recall Theorem 2.11, where the expected terminal PnL is
given by (2.3). Furthermore, we can decompose the variance of the terminal PnL, given in equations

In the remainder of this section we first give an example how the main theorem can be used
and then proceed to draw a parallel to the classical case and explain how our theorem extends
classical formulas to the path-dependent case.
Remark 3.1. The matrix Σsig and vector µsig are just placeholders for different terms and combi). Hence, all we need in order to know what our optimal functional is, is the
nations of E(ẐLL,<∞
0,T
expected Hoff lead-lag signature, and this is straightforward to compute for reasonable orders of
truncation and number of assets and factors. The following example aims to provide some practical
intuition behind how the optimal strategy is calculated and the relation between the signature and
words on the tensor algebra.
Example 3.1. Let us consider the case of when we have two assets X = (X 1 , X 2 ), one factor f ,
such that d = 2, N = 1. Then we define the 4-dimensional market factor process Ẑ := (t, X, f ).
Let us fix the truncation level to be M = 2. We remark that Example 2.1 is of the same form,
2
and so the 2nd level truncated signature Z≤2
0,t has |W4 | = 21 terms, namely the associated words
are:

W42 = ∅, 0, 1, 2, 3, 00, 01, 02, 03, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 33
(3.6)
Hence, the optimal linear signature trading strategy will correspond to two linear functionals
(one for each asset) ℓ1 , ℓ2 , each of length 21, defined as
ξt1 = ⟨ℓ1 , Ẑ≤2
0,t ⟩

ξt2 = ⟨ℓ2 , Ẑ≤2
0,t ⟩

sig
In the above theorem, we can see the vector µsig = (µsig
1 , µ2 ) will be defined as follows:
 

LL,≤3
sig
µ := E Ẑwf (m)
.
w∈W42 ,m=1,2

M
Hence, µsig will be a d · |WN
+d+1 | = 2 × 21 = 42 length vector, containing elements of the expected
lead-lag signature of order 3.

16

Recall that the shift operator f (m) is defined for each asset m = 1, 2 as:
f (1) = 5
f (2) = 6.
which correspond to the 5th and 6th dimensions of the lead-lag process. Hence, we see that µsig
1
contains the expected lead-lag signature terms corresponding to the index of words
I1 := {5, 05, 15, 25, 35, 005, 015, 025, 035, 105, 115, 125, 135, 205, 215, 225, 235, 305, 315, 325, 335}
and µsig
2 contains the expected lead-lag signature terms corresponding to the index of words
I2 := {6, 06, 16, 26, 36, 006, 016, 026, 036, 106, 116, 126, 136, 206, 216, 226, 236, 306, 316, 326, 336} ,
such that we have:

Intuitively, we can think of each element of µsig as the expected attribution that each signature term
has to a given assets future returns. For example, consider the term of the signature corresponding

therefore the vector µsig consists of expected PnL attribution for each of the 21 terms of the
signature of the factor process that we observe.

Each element of this matrix represents a covariance term between the PnL attributions that
we discussed previously. For example, let us observe an arbitrary element of Σsig . Let w = 01, v =

where 015 236 is a sum of 20 different words in W46 . We refer the reader also to Example A.2
for another example of the shuffle product. It is evident that, while our linear functional is only
applied to the second order truncated signature, we require the sixth order signature in order to
compute the covariance matrix, which can cause a computational bottleneck in practice.
Piecing this altogether, to obtain our optimal solution ℓ∗ = (ℓ∗1 , ℓ∗2 ), we have
ℓ∗ = (Σsig )−1 µsig
of which we obtain a 42-dimensional vector ℓ∗ consisting of two length 21 vectors ℓ∗1 , ℓ∗2 . We can
then compute the trading strategy, for each time t, as
ξt1 = ⟨ℓ∗1 , Ẑ≤2
0,t ⟩

ξt2 = ⟨ℓ∗2 , Ẑ≤2
0,t ⟩.
Note also how we can explicitly calculate the expected PnL and variance of the portfolio explicitly
in this framework. Let ℓ be the 42-length vector ℓ = (ℓ∗1 , ℓ∗2 ), then we have
E(VT ) = ℓ⊤ µsig
Var(VT ) = ℓ⊤ Σsig ℓ.

a wealth of path-dependent characteristics about our assets and how they are driven by the past
price trajectory and the past trajectory of the market factors. At this point, we observe this
solution is analogous is to the classical framing of an optimal factor model under the mean-variance
framework, seen in (1.3) and (1.5). In the classical factor model framework, for N factors f =

where (Σ−1 B)m is the m-th row of the d × N matrix Σ−1 B. Therefore βm := λ1 (Σ−1
t B)m represents
a risk-weighted transformation of the coefficients used in the prediction step. This sequence of N
coefficients are then applied to the factors via an inner product to obtain the position for the m-th
asset, πtm ∈ R. We can see just how similar this example is to the sig-factor model.

factors f = f 1 , . . . , f N in (3.7) were the terms of the signature? In this case, the answer is no.
The sole reason for this is due to the prediction phase in the classical factor model which induces

observed factors at time t, meaning the linear functionals βm and ℓm would not be the same.
Due to powerful results from rough path theory, we are able able to bypass the prediction phase
by lifting and projecting our market factor process into a much higher dimensional space. Using
Theorem 2.3, we can express the expected future PnL as a linear functional on the expected Hoff
lead-lag signature and then perform the optimisation (3.1) in this much higher-dimensional space,
without inducing any errors originating from a least-squares regression.

3.2

Optimal Static Portfolio

By design, a Signature Trading Strategy, ξt = ⟨ℓ, Ẑ0,t ⟩, is a dynamic strategy that continuously
updates its position at time t, depending on the value of Ẑ0,t . However, we recall that the signature
is defined at each level as
Ẑ0,t = (1, Ẑ10,t , . . . , ẐN
0,t , . . . )
where the k-th level has dk elements. We observe that in fact the zero-th level of the signature is
equal to 1, and so if we choose to only trade depending on this level of the signature, any linear
functional ℓ applied to 1, will just return a static position for all time t ∈ [0, T ]. Therefore, for a
d-asset portfolio, we obtain
ξt1 = ⟨ℓ1 , 1⟩ = ℓ1 ∈ R,
..
.

∀t ∈ [0, T ]

ξtd = ⟨ℓd , 1⟩ = ℓd ∈ R,

∀t ∈ [0, T ].

19

Using Theorem 3.1, we have that ℓ = (ℓ1 , . . . , ℓd ) ∈ Rd , where
ℓ=

1
(Σsig )−1 µsig .
2λ

Since we are trading with respect to the zero-th order of the signature, then the only word w that we

are interested in is w = ∅, therefore the number of words in our linear functional is |WN
+d+1 | = 1.
Hence, we can define the d-dimensional vector

which naturally corresponds to the covariance matrix of the returns for each of the d assets.
We can see how this solution will in fact yield us the same results as the classical Markowitz
portfolio, provided we use the same historical period to calculate the expected returns and covariances, of which we provide further evidence by constructing the Sig-Factor Model extension of the
efficient frontier.

3.3

Sig-Factor Model Efficient Frontier

In Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), first introduced in [Mar52], the mean-variance optimal portfolio
can be represented via the efficient frontier, which contains all portfolios that have the maximal
Sharpe ratio. In the Sig-factor model, we can also obtain an efficient frontier that represents
the relationship between expected returns and variance. For a given signature trading strategy
ξtm = (ξt1 , . . . , ξtd ), where ξtm = ⟨ℓm , Ẑ0,t ⟩, we can explicitly define the expected PnL and variance
of our portfolio in terms of the matrix Σsig and vector µsig , as defined in Theorem 3.1, e.g we have
E(VT ) = ℓ⊤ µsig
Var(VT ) = ℓ⊤ Σsig ℓ.
Therefore, for any linear functional ℓ, we can observe the expected PnL and variance corresponding
to it.
In Figure 8, the LHS represents the level-3 Sig-trader efficient frontier curve for a portfolio consisting of the ETFs DBC/BND/VTI. This demonstrates the relationship between portfolio returns
and variance, just as Markowitz had posed. The orange circle corresponds to the mean-variance

optimal sig-trading strategy ℓ∗ for a given maximum variance ∆, according to the solution provided in Theorem 3.1. Each of the smaller dots then represent different choices of linear functional
l, that are perturbations of the original strategy. We clearly observe that the Sig-trader portfolio
maximises the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio), for a given level of risk, ∆.
On the RHS, we observe the efficient frontier curve for different orders of Sig-trader, between
levels 0 to 3. Firstly, as eluded to previously, we can observe that the zero-th order Sig-trader
is in fact identical to the static Markowitz portfolio, meaning that their frontier curves are not
distinguishable from one another. We can also observe the improvement that is made to our
expected returns, as we introduce more levels of the signature. This shouldn’t be a surprise, as we
know that more information about the dynamics is explained as we increase the level of truncation,
which suggests that non-linear dependency structures are drivers of the future asset returns.

Implementation

Throughout this work, we use the package signatory ([KL21]), alongside PyTorch for calculating
and performing functionality related to tensors and the signature transform. Other packages offering
signature computation include esig and iisignature. The mean-variance Sig-Trading framework
is very simple to implement and does not require heavy machinery while comparative machine
learning methods may require extensive network building and hyperparameter tuning for every
time the user wants to perform a new optimisation. Signature-trading is a one-model-fits-all type
framework that is flexible enough to adapt to different types of signal and underlying asset process.
The algorithm to find an optimal trading strategy can be found in Algorithm 1.
The method is also self-contained in the sense that it requires no user inputted assumptions
such as expected returns or covariances and that they are inferred along with characteristics of the
whole process within the algorithm itself. Once a linear functional ℓ is obtained from past data
samples it is straightforward to unravel this into an implementable trading strategy characterised
by the number of units to buy/sell at each time point t ∈ [0, T ]. Since the strategy is dynamic, as
new data arrives the Sig-Trader will continuously compute the signature and update their position
accordingly.
Whilst Sig-Trading is data driven and does not require direct probabilistic assumptions on the
underlying model, just like most frameworks, there is versatility when deploying Sig-Trading in

21

practice as there does still remain quantities that need reliably estimating in the fitting procedure.
The expected lead-lag signature could be noisy when calibrated through time and so we leave any
questions of robustness (with respect to the fitting procedure) to future ongoing extensions of this
project, as there remains question marks over how well defined such a solution is, especially in the
context of rapidly changing regimes such as in financial markets. In step (4) of Algorithm 1, we
suggest taking a Monte Carlo
approach by calculating the empirical expected lead-lag signature,
1 PM
LL,≤N
such that E(Ẑ
) = M i=1 ẐLL,≤N
t∈[0,T ] . However, there remains a multitude of alternative ways
to approach this for some given sample/fitting data, such as cross validation techniques, in order
to ensure robustness out of sample. This paper does not directly discuss these approaches but we
do point out that any traders favourite statistical estimation and training procedures can work in
this setting. It may be that more recent training data is more important for fitting and this may
be incorporated via a rolling fitted model - but this may lead to overfitting. Hence, in this paper
we leave such statistical procedures directly to the discretion of the user and instead provide a
framework in which such techniques can be ensembled.

Likewise, while signature trading strategies do a good job of drawdown control, we do not
discuss extra practicalities such as vol-scaling positions in this paper. Due to the nested nature
of filtrations in this work (i.e. we are in possession of strictly increasing amounts of information
22

through time), this may impact performance of a trading strategy differently through the life
of the trade, hence it would make practical sense to smoothe out Sig-Trading positions through
time - this also can reduce any bias that may arise from the exact start date of the trade. We
also suggest that, especially at higher frequencies, that we could replace time-augmentation with
volume-augmentation since this is still a monotonically increasing channel in the process (ensuring
the signature remains unique), but represents a new notion of time.

Numerical Results

Throughout this section, we aim to demonstrate and highlight some of the capabilities of the
Sig-Trading framework, incorporating path-dependencies and exogenous signals.

5.1

Synthetic Data

5.1.1

Pairs Trading

First, we explore the scenario in which we have no exogenous trading signal to enrich our trading strategy but we only have access to the underlying time series of the asset process. The true
advantage that data-driven methods have over classical parametric frameworks is that they can
exploit the inefficiencies present in financial time series data, without specifying the explicit dynamics that they are trying to capture. In this toy example, we aim to isolate one specific aspect
that is exhibited by time series data and highlight how the Sig-Trader exploits it. Pairs Trading
is one of the most famous and original active trading strategies deployed by investors that focuses
on trading the joint behaviour between two assets. The sentiment is that while both assets have
their own dynamics, the difference (spread) between the prices of the two assets should hold some
predictability on future (co-)movements. Classical literature focuses on modelling this relationship
using a mean-reverting process such as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The strategy should then
contain a buy signal when the spread falls below some threshold and a sell signal when the spread
is above the threshold, in the anticipation that this spread should converge back to the threshold.
More on mean-reversion strategies can be found in [AD02; Vid04; MPW08; CJ15; LL15].
In this experiment we take two assets such that
dXt = σ X dWtX
dYt = κ(Xt − Yt )dt + σ Y dWtY
23

Where X is a standard arithmetic Brownian motion with zero drift and volatility σ X . Y however is
modelled as a mean-reverting process where its drift is proportional to the spread between X and
Y . We can clearly see in this toy example that the only exploitable alpha within the framework is
the temporal dependence through mean-reversion in Y since there is no long term drift in X or Y .

Figure 9: Sharpe ratio distribution (LHS) and Sig-Trader strategy as a function of the spread
between the two assets (RHS).
If a trader was to deploy a static buy and hold strategy here, the PnL would be zero on average,
however, for higher order Sig-Traders, it is possible to exploit the mean-reversion dynamics. In fact,
this example demonstrates how the above-mentioned alpha is self-contained within the 1st level of
the signature (which is the increment of the path, or the ‘drift’) and so orders of N ≥ 2 do not
contain any more predictive power on excess returns than that of N = 1. However, on the right
hand side (RHS) of Figure 9, the signature efficient frontier illustrates that when trading with a
weekly look-forward horizon, the ratio of return to variance of weekly PnL is greater as we increase
the order of the Sig-Trader. This is due to the higher levels of the signature capturing non-linear
path-dependencies that can help reduce variance in the weekly PnL distribution. We relate back to
Figure 2 to demonstrate that in fact higher order Sig-Traders are able to construct mean-reverting
strategies that naturally limit drawdowns, which are an inherently path-dependent characteristic.
In this synthetic example, we compare the Sig-Trader strategy to that of the original factor
model. The generic factor model is set up as a supervised linear regression on future returns, as a
function of the current signature,
µt+1 = E[rt+1 |Ft ] = BSt + εt+1
where r is the 2-dimensional asset returns, B is a 2 × N matrix of factor coefficients, St is a vector
of the signature values of the and ε is a vector of the 2 assets’ (unexplained) residuals returns. We
can see that this model uses the same input as the Sig-Trader (the signature), with the same tools
(applying a linear function).
The key distinguishment is that the factor model is optimal for maximising the daily meanvariance PnL profile, which ignores any long term, pathwise dynamics of the strategy itself. Figure 10 demonstrates the difference in nature between the Sig-Trader and the factor model. In the
order 1 case, as described above, the exploitable alpha in terms of returns are captured by the 1st
level of the signature and so we see a similar position profile for the Sig-Trader and the factor model.
However, when the factor model tends to go more short (or long), the higher order Sig-Traders,
e.g order 3, tends to reduce its position since this will be more beneficial to minimising the weekly
variance of PnL. We can think of this behaviur as being similar to applying a sigmoid function to
your position in search of robustness, or applying a stop-loss to avoid becoming too leveraged which are common practices. By incorporating path-dependencies in the strategy, we have access
to a more robust and intutive extension to classic factor models.

5.1.2

Incorporating Exogenous Signal

We now consider the case when we are in possession of an exogenous signal that can be used to
inform our trading decisions, rather than solely relying on raw asset time series data. Suppose the
asset price process X is driven by some function of the signal ϕ(t, f0,t ), e.g
dXt = ϕ(t, f0,t )dt + σ X dWtX .
Since ϕ(t, f0,t ) is a function of the past time series of f , it may be difficult for a trader to directly
model the dynamics of this system directly if they do not know the explicit form of ϕ. In practice, a
trader may use a Kalman (or alternative) filter to capture the impact of a noisy signal; in fact, the
authors in [Coh+23] prove how the Kalman filter can be equivalently written as a linear regression
on the signature. In this example, we propose the following system for the signal process f and its
consequent impact on the underlying asset X,
dft = −κft + σ f dWtf
Z t
Zt =
K(t − s)dfs
0

dXt = Zt dt + σ X dWtX .
We let the (observable) signal f be a generic mean-reverting OU process with zero mean, while
it has a path-dependent causal impact on some latent process Z via a time-dependent kernel K
that we do not observe. This kernel could simply be a stochastic filter, for example if the kernel is
exponential, we recover an exponentially weighted average of previous increments in the signal. In
this example, we take the kernel to be K(t, s) = exp{−α(t − s)}, which can be understood to be
a decaying impact of the signal on the process Z, i.e more recent observations of f have a greater
impact on the instantaneous drift. The asset price process X then behaves like an arithmetic
Brownian motion with long term zero drift, but short term temporal structure.
The underlying asset process X does not have a long term drift, so we would expect a static
strategy to have no long-term expected return, as seen in the left hand plot of Figure 12. In fact, we
notice that any excess return is marginal when the Sig-Trader trades endogenously without access
to the signal, which can be seen in the light blue distributions in Figure 12. The red distributions
correspond to the simple factor model that takes the value of the signal at time t and predicts the
future (one-step) return, i.e
µt+1 = E[rt+1 |Ft ] = βft + εt+1

(5.1)

where the position is then scaled according to the expected return mut+1 . The dark blue Sharpe
ratio distributions correspond to the Sig-Trader for different orders of truncation. Clearly, we

this system there are several layers of noise and complexities to sift through, including the pathdependent impact of the signal, as well as noise from the signal itself σ f and exogenous noise of
the underlying asset, σ X . In this simple system, this volatility of such randomness is constant
through time, but in practice this is likely not the case and this is the type of scenario when the
Sig-Trader can outperform the classic predict-then-optimise frameworks. The left hand side of

that is able to produce strong risk-adjusted returns.

Learning Momentum as a Sig-Trading Strategy

As highlighted previously, the class of signature trading strategies, contains most common systematic trading strategies that are functions of the past market time-series. One of the most common
and established forms of systematic trading strategy is trend following (and its multiple variants),
which generally applies some function (i.e a filter) to the past market time series, to determine
the strength and direction of the underlying asset trend. The trader then trades in this direction,
adjusting their position according to the strength (alternatively, they may we want to trade the
opposite direction, which would constitute a mean-reversion strategy). For a high-level overview
of the design and mechanics of momentum strategies, we refer the reader to [RD12; RA12], which
give a large discussion on both linear and non-linear momentum. For practical applications, see
[MOP12; AMP13; BK13; BS15; Lem+14].
Within the broader class of momentum strategies live several variants, and this is dependent on
your choice of function that characterises the trend. Variants (and combinations thereof) include
RSI indicators, Bollinger bands, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) or any other type
of moving average crossover. The key observation is that all of the previous mentioned variants
constitute alternative functions (filters) of the past time series, therefore a natural question to ask
is what are the best (or in fact optimal) types of function or filter to apply to the past market time
series, in order to capture the dynamics of the underlying asset? Since momentum strategies are
contained within the space of signature trading strategies, we are able to find the linear functional
corresponding to a given momentum strategy. To make this more precise, we focus on capturing
the characteristics of a MACD momentum strategy. We recall that MACD(t1 , t2 ) is the difference
between the (exponentially weighted) t1 -moving average (the fast signal) and the t2 -moving average
(the slow signal), designed to indicate strength of trend. The general setup might look as follows:
Time Series Paths, X0,t

ϕ

σ

L
MACD

Future Returns

Strategy Position, ξt

This is a very general framework that takes a given filter (i.e the MACD), uses it to predict
future returns, and then applies some normalisation (i.e a sigmoid function) in order to retrieve a
final strategy position. We note that a momentum strategy should naturally result in a positive
regression coefficient of L since a positive MACD signal indicates that the asset is ‘trending’ (otherwise, if the coefficient was negative, this would imply mean-reversion). We can think of this whole
framework as being one continuous function of the past path, i.e
ξt = φ(t, X0,t ) = σ(L(ϕ(t, X0,t ))).
The goal is therefore to demonstrate that the function φ can be captured via a signature trading
strategy such that φ(t, X0,t ) = ⟨ℓ, X̂0,t ⟩.
Figure 14 displays the corresponding MACD filter, which we denote ϕ, while Figure 15 shows
the improvement of learnt linear functionals ℓ, as the order of truncation of the signature increases.
We notice that the order 3 signature is able to approximate the function φ with almost 90% R2
accuracy, even though both the filter ϕ and the normalisation function σ are highly non-linear.
Given that we are able to approximate the momentum trading strategy via a Sig-Trading
strategy, we can compare this strategy to the mean-variance optimal order 3 strategy. Using the
learnt linear functional ℓ, we are able to construct the efficient frontier via the expected terminal
PnL and variance of terminal PnL,
E(VT ) = ℓ⊤ µsig
Var(VT ) = ℓ⊤ Σsig ℓ.

27

Figure 16 (LHS) demonstrates that the optimal order 3 Sig-Trader has a much better risk-return
profile over the chosen trade horizon of 20 days (one month), than that of the learnt momentum
trader. It is worth noting however that the Sig-Trader in this example has many similar characteristics to that of the momentum trader, however the optimal Sig-Trader was able to capture further

lower monthly variance. The convex return profile of the order 3 Sig-Trader (RHS of Figure 16) is
reminiscent of a trend following strategy that earns positive returns with high conviction in trending
(upwards or downwards) markets. This example shows us that in fact, besides from focusing on an
optimal Sig-Trading solution, by re-casting other strategies in the same format, it can inform us
better on how our strategies work and the various exposures that may exist. It might be such that
a given strategy is largely exposed to specific terms in the signature, which can explain more about
its characteristics and associated risks. We can also analyse how ‘far away’ our strategies are to an
optimal Sig-Trading solution and hence better optimise for dynamic risks.

Conclusion

Path dependencies such as non-Markovian data structures, or time series exhibiting temporal correlation are a frequent phenomenon in financial data. Momentum and mean-reversion (of assets
or signals) are two of the purest features of time series’ data that a trader can exploit, and these
features are inherently reliant on the whole path. However, many traditional techniques used for
portfolio oprimisation are too inflexible to handle such structural complexities of the data and
signals. Signature trading strategies, first developed and covered in detail in the thesis of Perez
([Per20]), are a versatile representation of any investment strategy, which have been demonstrated
to be a powerful tool in the context of pricing, hedging, and optimal execution.
We observe that in fact their advantages can be carried over to more general portfolio optimisation problems as they encompass many common trading styles that are present in practice
(including the before-mentioned momentum and mean-reversion). More specifically, in this paper
we extend classical factor models into the Sig-Trading framework, obtaining a closed form solution
to the optimal mean-variance Sig-Trading strategy and derive a clear intuition for portfolio managers to navigate and use this formula in a path-dependent context. Furthermore, by lifting the
mean-variance optimisation into the lead-lag signature space (See Definition 2.3), we bypass the
necessity for any explicit prediction of returns, which is commonly required in traditional settings.
This alleviates the accumulation of asymmetric residuals from the prediction phase, which can often be difficult to control. Moreover, the Sig-Trading framework simultaneously captures the joint
signal-asset dynamics, whilst performing a dynamic optimisation which naturally incorporates a
drawdown control within the objective function.
In summary, the Sig-Trading framework provides an alternative to machine learning methods,
in its ability to handle path-dependent, non-linear dynamics and signals in a portfolio opitmisation
context. Unlike machine learning methods, our framework requires no training or gradient descent
optimisation and provides a closed-form solution that is lightweight to work with in practice. Our
closed-form solution is tractable, easily implementable and ensures interpretability of the derived
optimal strategies. Overall, our results provide more intuition than ML-based methods and establish
more discretion in the fitting procedure than classical methods, providing a malleable framework
that still solves many challenges faced when working with financial data.

Rough Path & Tensor Algebra Preliminaries

We aim to keep this paper self-contained by recalling the concepts and definitions we explicitly
use in this paper. In this appendix we recall necessary fundamental building blocks used in our
derivations.

A.1

The Tensor Algebra

In this section, we define the space on which the signature is defined and introduce notations that
are used throughout the paper.
Definition A.1. (Tensor Algebra). Let d ≥ 1. We define the extended tensor algebra over Rd by

o
d
T ((R )) := a = (a0 , a1 , . . . , an , . . . ) an ∈ (Rd )⊗n
Similarly, we define the truncated tensor algebra of order N ∈ N and the tensor algebra by T (N ) (Rd )
and T (Rd ) respectively, by

o
(N )
d
d ⊗n
T (R ) := a = (an )∞

(Rd )⊗n ⊂ T ((Rd )).

Note that the truncated tensor algebra of order N has dimension

dN +1 −1
k
k=0 d =
d−1 .

PN

Remark A.1. Intuitively, we have that the zero-th level of the tensor algebra, (Rd )⊗0 , is simply
the set of all scalars a0 ∈ R, with dimension d0 = 1. At the first level, (Rd )⊗1 is the set of all
R-valued vectors of length d, with dimension d1 . Likewise, at the second level, (Rd )⊗2 is the set of
all R-valued d × d matrices. Then the truncated tensor algebra at order 2, T (2) (Rd ), has dimension
1 + d + d2 and contains all Rd -valued tensors of order 0, 1, 2.
Definition A.2. (Dual Space of the Tensor Algebra). Let {e1 , . . . , ed } ⊂ Rd be a basis for Rd ,
then it has a dual basis {e∗1 , . . . , e∗d } ⊂ (Rd )∗ for (Rd )∗ , the dual space of Rd . Recall that this dual
space is the space of all linear functions Rd → R. We may similarly define a basis for T ((Rd )) and
its dual space T ((Rd )∗ ).
We identify this dual space of the tensor algebra, T ((Rd )∗ ), with the space of all words. Consider
the following alphabet Ad := {1, . . . , d}, which consists of d letters. In order to ease notations, we
make the following identification:
e∗i1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ e∗in ∈ T ((Rd )∗ ) ↔ i1 . . . in ∈ W(Ad ),

(A.1)

where W(Ad ) is the real vector space of all words with the alphabet Ad . The empty word will
be denoted by ∅. We then have the identification T ((Rd )∗ ) = W(Ad ). That is, that any linear
functional ℓ : T ((Rd )) → R can be identified via elements in W(Ad ). Hence we can think of words
as linear functions on the tensor algebra.
Example A.1. Let X ∈ T ((Rd )) be an element of the tensor algebra. We can view X in terms of

30

its elements within the tensor algebra and each multi-index corresponding to a word, e.g.

The space of all words is defined as
W(Ad ) = {∅, 1, . . . , d, 11, . . . , dd, . . . }.
Two algebraic operations on W(Ad ) are the sum and concatenation. The sum of two words w and v
is just the formal sum w + v ∈ W(Ad ). The concatenation of w = i1 . . . in , v = j1 . . . jm ∈ W(Ad )
is defined by
wv := i1 . . . in j1 . . . jm ∈ W(Ad ).
With some abuse of notation, we will then use the concatenation on W(Ad ) and T ((Rd )∗ ) interchangeably, in the sense that we will sometimes write ℓw for ℓ ∈ T ((Rd )∗ ), w ∈ W(Ad ).
Definition A.3. (Shuffle Product). The shuffle product
inductively by
ua

 vb = (u  vb)a + (ua  v)b
w∅=∅w =w

for all words u, v and letters a, b ∈ W(Ad ).
Example A.2. Let w = 12, v = 34, then w
12

 : W(Ad) × W(Ad) → W(Ad) is defined

 v is given by

 34 = 1234 + 1324 + 1342 + 3124 + 3142 + 3412

Remark A.2. We make extensive use of the fact that polynomials of linear functionals can be
expressed as shuffle products of the linear functionals themselves.

A.2

Rough Paths & The Signature

Definition A.4. (p-variation). Let p ≥ 1 and X : [t′ , T ] → Rd be a d-dimensional continuous path.
We say the p-variation of X is denoted as the seminorm
1



p

∥X∥p = sup
P

X
[s,t]∈P

∥Xt − Xs ∥

p

where ∥·∥ is any norm on Rd and the supremum is taken over all partitions P of the interval [t′ , T ].
Definition A.5. (Space of p-variation paths). We denote the space of all R-valued d-dimensional
paths of finite p-variation, to be C p−var ([0, T ]; Rd ).
Remark A.3. We refer to the paths of bounded variation as elements of the space C 1−var ([0, T ]; Rd ).
Note that all continuous piecewise smooth paths X0,T ∈ C 1−var ([0, T ]; Rd ).
31

Definition A.6. (Geometric p-rough paths). We define the space of geometric p-rough paths,
G⌊p⌋ (Rd ), as the closure of the space of signatures of smooth paths, at order ⌊p⌋, namely
G⌊p⌋ (Rd ) :=



X≤N : ∆T → T (N ) (Rd )

N = ⌊p⌋

dp−var

where the closure is with respect to the p-variation metric (defined in [LCL07], Definition 1.5).
Theorem A.7. (Extension Theorem, [LCL07], Theorem 3.7). Let p > 1 be a real number and
⌊p⌋ (Rd ) be the truncated signature at level N ∈ N of the path X
d
X≤N
s,t ∈ Xs,t . Then for every
s,t ∈ G
n ≥ ⌊p⌋ + 1, there exists a unique Xns,t such that
⌊p⌋

(s, t) 7→ Xs,t = (1, X1s,t , . . . , Xs,t , . . . , Xns,t , . . . ) ∈ T ((Rd ))
has finite p-variation. We denote Xs,t as the extension of X≤N

⟨ℓ1 , X<∞

Remark A.5. The shuffle product property is heavily used in deriving an explicit representation of
the variance of PnL in Section 3.
Proposition A.9. (Signature is point-seperating, ( [HL10], [Boe+16] )). Let X : [0, T ] → Rd ,
[p]
d
then its signature X<∞
0,T ∈ G (R ) is unique up to tree like equivalence and translation.
Corollary A.9.1. Let X̂ : [0, T ] → Rd+1 be the associated add-time process of X. Then its
signature X̂<∞
0,T uniquely determines X up to translations.
Definition A.10. (Probability measure on the space of paths). Let (Ω, F, (Ft )t∈[0,T ] , P) be a
filtered probability space such that F = (Ft )t∈[0,T ] is the filtration generated by the non-negative
Rd -valued stochastic process X = (Xt )t∈[0,T ] . We say its path trajectories X0,T are sampled under
d ) as the set of all such probability measures.

Definition A.11. (Expected Signature). Let X be defined as previous. Then for any such Rd valued random path X0,T , we can see that taking its signature X0,T is also a random variable under

The map P 7→ EP X<∞

Remark A.6. The expected signature allows us to systematically characterize the empirical probability measure on the streams in a model-free sense. The expected signature of paths X ∼ P, i.e
EP [X<∞
0,T ] can be thought of as the moment generating function of a path-valued random variables
X. We must also note, however, that the assumption that the expected signature even exists at all
is a strong assumption for all levels of the signature N ∈ N. For example, the authors in [Bay+21]
highlight that this rules out many stochastic volatility models, such as the Heston model.
Lemma A.12. (Factorial Decay).
The reason we are able to work with the truncated signature with sufficient confidence is due
d
to the factorial decay of the terms of the signature. Let X ∈ X0,T

[s, t] ⊂ [0, T ]. Then ∀n ≥ 1

Theorem A.13. (Universal Approximation, [LLN13], Theorem 3.1). Let K ⊂ C 1−var ([0, T ], Rd )1
be a compact subset of paths. For any ϕ ∈ C(K, R), and for every ϵ > 0, there exists a linear
functional ℓ ∈ T ((Rd ))∗ such that
sup ∥ϕ(X) − ⟨ℓ, X<∞
0,T ⟩∥ < ϵ

X∈K

where the choice of suitable candidate topology is discussed in [CT22].
Remark A.7. If we imagine that the optimal adapted dynamic trading strategy ξt is simply a
function of the past path, i.e ξt : X0,t 7→ ϕ(X0,t ) for some non-linear ϕ, then Theorem A.13 allows
us to approximate the non-linear ϕ by ϕ(X0,t ) ≈ ⟨ℓ, X<∞
0,t ⟩ where ℓ is linear. This will be made
more precise in Section 2.

signature of X̂0,T by X̂<∞
0,T and the signature of the lead-lag process X̂0,T
Example A.3. (Linear functional on the signature). Let X = (X 1 , . . . , X d ) : [0, T ] → Rd be a
d-dimensional path. We previously made the identification that any linear functional on the tensor
algebra can be identified via elements in the space of all words. Take for example:
1. Consider any signature term at the second level of the i-th and j-th component of X.

X0,T =
◦dXui ◦ dXuj =
(Xti − X0i ) ◦ dXtj = ⟨ij, X̂<∞
0,T ⟩
0

0<ui <uj <T

where we can think of ij as a word in the space W(Ad ), which can be identified as a linear
functional on the tensor algebra, as shown in (A.1).
2. Consider an arbitrary linear functional ℓ ∈ T ((Rd )∗ ) on the signature, then its (Stratonovich)
integral against the i-th component of the d-dimensional process X is simply the linear functional concatenated with the letter i, applied to the signature X<∞
0,T , such as:

K should be a subset of tree-reduced paths. However, as all of the paths we are concerned with are tree-reduced,
this is not an issue.

and f is a N -dimensional un-tradable factor process. Let ℓ1 , . . . , ℓd ∈ T ((RN +d+1 )∗ ) and define our
trading strategy as ξtm = ⟨ℓm , Ẑ<∞

for any truncation level M ≥ 1. For the case when M = 1, we have that

as defined in (3), which is proven in [FHL16], Theorem 4.1. Therefore, we can clearly see that

Hence, the statement (B.3) holds for M = 1. By the same proof seen in Lemma 3.2.11 in [Per20],
the result follows for all M ≥ 1 via induction, taking I = i1 i2 . . . ik ∈ {1, . . . , d}k for the multidimensional result.
We note here that by setting Z = (t, X, f ), we lose no strength in this argument, since we are still
only integrating against X m , for which the result then follows through f (m) for m = 1, . . . , d and
35

so any extra remaining exogenous factors embedded in Z do not change the result. Likewise, since
out portfolio PnL is defined asset-wise, the result holds for all assets m and so the overall trading
strategy PnL is defined as
